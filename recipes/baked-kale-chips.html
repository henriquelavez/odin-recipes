        <p>These crispy oven-baked kale chips are a great homemade snack. You cannot stop at just eating one, just like potato chips. Great for parties, too.</p>
        
        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <p>As easy as kale chips are to make, there are still a couple of tips to keep in mind for best results:</p>

        <h3>Dry leaves completely</h3>
        <p>The key to crispy kale chips is to make sure you thoroughly dry your kale leaves. Use paper towels or a dry dish towel to remove any drops of water that might remain after washing and spinning your kale. Damp leaves make soggy kale chips.</p>

        <h3>Don't overdo the oil</h3>
        <p>Use a light hand when you coat the dry kale leaves with olive oil. You don't want to drench them or they'll never crisp up.</p>

        <h3>Spread out</h3>
        <p>Use a large enough rimmed baking sheet so each kale leaf can lie flat in a single layer. Leaves that are bunched up or folded over won't crisp evenly. Bake in batches if you need to.</p>

        <h3>Don't overbake</h3>
        <p>When it comes to baked kale chips, brown equals bitter. That's why it can be a little tricky to know when your kale chips are fully baked because you can't really judge by the color. You want to remove baked kale chips from the oven before they brown but while they're still a bit soft in the center. But don't worry; they will continue to crisp up after you take them out of the oven and let cool. For perfectly crispy baked kale chips, you might have to do a little trial and error to find the right balance.</p>
